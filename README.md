## 🚀 About Me

I'm Daniel, a **Junior Frontend Developer** with an enriching and unconventional journey: I used to be a **psychologist**, a **football goalkeeper**, and a **flight attendant**, until I discovered a new passion: **web development**.

Since then, I’ve immersed myself in this exciting world where logic meets creativity. Although code might seem cold, I always bring my human side to the table: values, empathy, teamwork, and a true hunger for learning.

I’m currently a **Senior Web Application Development Technician**, and I’ve worked at **two companies** where I collaborated in real development teams and grew as a professional.

## 🧪 Other Experiences

### 👨‍💻 Internship at **Close Marketing** (2025)

I supported and collaborated in real-world client projects, gaining hands-on experience in:

- WordPress (GenerateBlocks, site maintenance and styling)
- Laravel (basic level)
- Website migrations and server configurations
- DNS and email setup
- Troubleshooting and web support

While WordPress isn't my long-term goal, this stage helped me understand real-world business environments and expand my versatility.

### 🌐 Internship at **Bracelit** (2024)

My first hands-on experience with the **Astro JavaScript** framework. I worked on a mini-project to improve the **Contact** section of the company's official site.

- We redesigned the contact section, focusing on UI and the form layout
- I implemented most of the **frontend work**: structure, styling, and validations
- I explored the **backend logic** behind the form’s data submission and handling

This was my first taste of real web development teamwork and it boosted my passion for the frontend.
